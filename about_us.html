					<h3>FUTURE OF MOVEMENT - EV'S</h3>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">Most Indian buyers believe that an electric vehicle will be ready by 2023, but the majority also believe that it would no longer be available until 2025. Consumers in India are looking for a lower price for EVs than those in other countries, with the global average tipping price for EVs being $36,000. (around Rs27 lakh).

								The cost of lithium-ion batteries is roughly $250/kWh globally, which translates to approximately Rs5.7 lakh in battery prices alone. Currently, lithium-ion batteries account for half of the cost of an electric vehicle, making them more expensive than conventional vehicles.
								
								The safety of the batteries against explosion serves as a stumbling block for Li-ion batteries. Charging is a significant barrier for EVs in India, and a lack of charging stations may also be considered, rendering them impracticable or significantly less feasible for long-distance rides.
								
								Furthermore, some EVs are slower than standard gas-powered engines.
								
								At a critical moment, as many nations are working to free Mother Earth from the clutches of carbon emissions and CO2, India should take the lead by transitioning to EV mobility, making the country a greener and cleaner ecosystem.
							</p>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">The global sales of electric vehicles are witnessing an increased yearly growth. 2022 was a watershed year for EV manufacturers as the country restarted after the covid pandemic selling more than 10 lakh units, marking a three-fold increase in sales compared to 2021. Among the different categories of electric vehicles sold in India, the two-wheeler segment boasted 63% of the total sales.

									</p>
									<p style="font-size:16px">Governments provide incentives to encourage EV adoption, such as tax credits, subsidies, and infrastructure development. In India, the government actively encourages the adoption of electric vehicles through the faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (FAME 2) scheme. In this scheme, customers can avail of a subsidy of up to Rs 30,000 for electric two-wheelers, Rs 1.5 lahk for purchasing a three-wheeler, and Rs 5.5 lakh for purchasing a four-wheeler.

					<h3>Brief History</h3>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">This Centre was inaugurated by Prof. Yogesh Singh, Hon’ble Vice-Chancellor, Delhi Technological University on 7th October 2021. This Centre is jointly funded by Delhi Knowledge Development Foundation (DKDF), Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Delhi Technological University, Delhi. CoE for EVRT focused research areas will include, but not be limited to design, development, and analysis of electric vehicle motors and drives, charging station infrastructure, charge controllers, communication infrastructure for information dissemination between the power grid and EVs, battery management systems, retrofitting, etc. This Centre is not only providing interdisciplinary research and development ecosystems but also offering internships, skills development courses, entrepreneurship programs and facilitating industrial trainings for undergraduate/postgraduate students and research scholars. In addition, the Centre will also offer regular PG/certificate courses in the near future. The facility will strive for networking and collaboration with industries, research laboratories, and other institutions of excellence in India and abroad to carry out cutting-edge research and development in EVs, along with offering postgraduate programmes.
							</p>
              <p style="font-size:16px;">Many faculty members of the Department of Electrical Engineering, DTU are already working in different areas related to electric vehicles technologies through various sponsored research projects. These islands of research endeavors and the expertise of the faculty members involved in them is being gainfully collaborated for development of CoE for EVRT. In a very short span, the CoE for EVRT has established a strong industry-academia collaborations to achieve the objectives of the centre. The main focus of the centre includes:

				»Design, development, and analysis of cost-effective and sustainable Electric Vehicles prototype
				
				»Design and development of battery packs and BMS for different types of Electric Vehicles.
				
				»Design, development, and analysis of Electric Vehicles motors and drives.
				
				»Design and retro-fitment of conventional vehicles to Electric Vehicles.
				
				»Design and development of electric vehicles charging infrastructure and grid​ management.
				
				»To offer M. Tech and Ph.D. programs in the area of electric vehicles technology.
				
				» To offer internship opportunities to the students of degree, diploma and certificate level institutions under Govt of NCT of Delhi.
				
				»Capacity building in terms of trained manpower at different levels such as technicians, supervisors and engineers in the area of Electric Vehicle technology.
